# Fibonacci Sequence Generator in C++

A simple C++ program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms. The program demonstrates basic input validation, loops, and arithmetic operations using `long long` to handle large numbers in the sequence.

---

## Features

- Prompts the user to input the number of Fibonacci terms to generate.
- Validates input to ensure it is a positive integer.
- Iteratively calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence.
- Handles large Fibonacci numbers using `long long` variables.
